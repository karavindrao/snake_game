# snake_game
An implementation of the snake game in c

# Directions:
1. For manual control, complile `gcc snake_user_main.c snake_fn.c`
2. For the automatic version using a greedy algorithm, compile `gcc snake_auto_main.c snake_fn.c snake_vis.c`

`snake_vis.c` is for visualising the garden with snake and apple on the terminal. Here it is included only in `snake_auto_main.c`. Add the function wherever you like.
